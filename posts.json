In this post, I’ll dive deep into how JavaScript can enhance design by adding interactivity.\n\nI’ll share how animations, user interactions, and dynamic changes can be achieved with just a few lines of code. Through JavaScript, I’m now able to create interfaces that not only look great but respond to user behavior—whether that’s a smooth transition, a custom animation, or even real-time data updates."

As a designer, I had the luxury of focusing on creativity, but as a developer, I’m constantly balancing both the creative and logical sides of my brain.\n\nTo stay productive, I’ve adopted tools like Trello for task management, and GitHub for version control. But beyond tools, I’ve also focused on creating productive habits—like working in blocks of time, regularly reviewing my goals, and using resources like online communities and open-source projects to keep learning. In this post, I’ll talk about how I’ve structured my time and projects to stay on track and make the most of my learning."

  "content": "As I moved deeper into the world of UI/UX development, one of the most important skills I had to master was **responsive design**. Coming from a graphic design background, I was used to creating static, fixed-size designs. But the web is far from static—designs need to work across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.\n\nIn this post, I’ll share how I approached making my designs responsive and the tools I used to ensure they looked great on any device. Using **media queries**, **flexbox**, and **grid layouts**, I’ve learned to design interfaces that adapt smoothly to different screen sizes. This shift was a key milestone in my journey, as it forced me to think not just about aesthetics, but also about how users experience interfaces in different contexts.\n\nI’ll also discuss best practices for designing with mobile-first principles and how ensuring accessibility and usability for all users became a top priority in my process."
